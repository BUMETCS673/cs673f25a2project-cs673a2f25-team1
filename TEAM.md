Hi This is Ming Leong Tsui Lucas. Hi, this is Lucas (the one with the gray cap). I have a degree in physics and law, and I now work as an analyst for a consultant firm. I am good at Bayesian modeling, and database related tools like python, pandas, and SQL Server. Welcome to join my team to practice incorporating AI in collaborative workflow (to the extent that the academic rule allows), from development, collaboration down to writing meeting minutes. In my spare time I love playing automation games like Factorio, Satisfactory, and Dyson Sphere Programme, and some Helldivers 2.

Hi This is Xinyu Wang (Iris): Hi everyone, I'm  Xinyu Wang. Also you could call me Iris. I am now pursing my master in Computer Science at Boston University. Professionally, as a software developer Intern at Oerlikon , I developed automated testing scripts in Python to streamline low-pressure system testing.In my research project on digital health consulting systems, I combined Transformer and U-Net architectures in Python for medical image segmentation for diagnostic insights. I’m comfortable working with C++, Python, and various software tools, and I’m always willing to learn new technologies and tools. More importantly, I always have an open and cooperative attitude—I like to listen, adapt, and contribute so that we can work well together.
